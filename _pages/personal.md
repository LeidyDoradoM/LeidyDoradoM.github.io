I was born in a small village called Bolivar in the Region of Cauca in Colombia, but I grew up in a small city called Popayan, which is the main city of the Cauca region. I have been living far from my home country and family since 2007.  In 2009, I found my soulmate who I share my life with.  We have a beagle mix called Talos. He is a well-behaved dog, full of kind and love. We like to take Talos for walks while he enjoys to greet people along the walks. 

I like all kind of latin music and I consider myself a very decent dancer of these rythms. In my spare time I like to watch tv series, hear music and enjoy sharing time with friends.
