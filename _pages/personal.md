Born and raised in Colombia, I have been living far from my home country since 2007. While I was living in Puerto Rico I met my husband who was also pursing a MS degree.  We got married in 2011 and early this year our baby girl was born.  We have a beagle mix called Talos. He is a well-behaved dog, full of kind and love. We like to take Talos for walks while he enjoys to greet people along the walks. 

I like all kind of latin music and I consider myself a very decent dancer of these rythms. In my spare time I like to watch tv series, hear music and enjoy sharing time with friends.
