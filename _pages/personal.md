I was born in a small village called Bolivar in the Region of Cauca in Colombia, but I grew up in a small city called Popayan, which is the main city of the Cauca region. I have been living far from my home country and family since 2007.  In 2009, I found my soulmate who I shared my life with, and we have a dog called Talos.  I like all kind of latin music and I consider myself a very decent dancer of these rythms.   In my spare time I like to watch tv series, hear music and enjoy to share time with friends.
