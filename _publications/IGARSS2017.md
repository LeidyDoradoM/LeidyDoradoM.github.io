**Abstract:** The Schroedinger Eigenmaps (SE) embedding has been previously introduced and applied to spectral target detection problems in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). The proposed SE-based detection approach combines the spectral and spatial connectivity of target-like pixels into the Schroedinger operator by using a “knowledge propagation” scheme. Likewise, it has been noted the impact that the local data structure modeling has over the SE-based detector. This local data structure is modeled by using an adjacency graph, i.e, set of vertices and edges, that in most of the applications is a k nearest neighbor (knn) graph. In this paper, the impact of k in the graph-building process is analyzed and assessed from a target detection point of view. Two ways to estimate the parameter k in the graph construction are considered and their assessment is performed by using two HSI data sets and the Receiver Optimal Curve (ROC) as a detection performance metric.
