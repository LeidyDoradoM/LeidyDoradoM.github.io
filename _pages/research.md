Over the last 10 years I have been working on the development of different methods for processing 
hyperspectral and multispectral data with application in remote sensing area. These are some of the
projects I have worked on:

* Interest point detection. My master thesis was related with the extension of the well-known Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) operator, proposed initially for grayscale images, to hyperspectral images. The key in 
the extension was focused on the the vector nature of the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) such that spectral features within bands is not lost.

* Object detection. In my time as research associate at University of Puerto Rico I continued working on the detection of objects or features in multispectral imagery. The project was related with the identification of ship signatures such as contaminant plumes in clouds and the spectral contrast between the ship and the sea background.

* Spectral object detection. In my doctorate I worked in the application of novel mathematic methods based on graph theory and nonlinear manifold algorithms to HSI exploitation, making emphasis in their applicability in spectral target detection.

* Gough map processing.  During my time as Postdoctoral researcher, I have been working on the application of different graph theory techniques in the processing of ancient docuements such as the famous Gough map of Great Britain dated to the end of 14th century.

In general, I have been focussed on the exploitation of hyperspectral data by using novel mathematical methods such as manifold learning and graph theory-based models.  Nowdays I am interested in the extension of the use of these methods in the Data Science area. I think that given these mathematical methods allow to model high-dimensional/ complex data, their application could be extended to handle all kind of data besides images.
