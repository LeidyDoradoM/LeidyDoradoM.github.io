**Abstract:** Understanding the capabilities of satellite sensors with spatial and spectral characteristics similar to those of MODIS for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is of importance because of the upcoming NPOES with 100 minutes revisit time carrying the MODIS-like VIIRS multispectral imaging sensor. This paper presents an experimental study of ship detection using MODIS imagery. We study the use of ship signatures such as contaminant plumes in clouds and the spectral contrast between the ship and the sea background for detection. Results show the potential and challenges for such approach in MDA.
